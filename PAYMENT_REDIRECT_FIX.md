# Payment Redirect Fix

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**

The payment was redirecting to `http://localhost:3000/checkout?` with a black page because:

1. **Payment succeeds** → `clearCart()` is called
2. **Cart becomes empty** → Checkout page detects empty cart
3. **Redirect conflict** → Page tries to redirect to both `/order-confirmation` and `/shop`
4. **Result** → Page ends up at `/checkout?` with no content

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### **1. Fixed Redirect Logic**
- Added `isPaymentSuccess` state to prevent cart redirect during payment success
- Modified cart redirect logic to respect payment success flag
- Used `window.location.href` for hard redirect to prevent conflicts

### **2. Updated Payment Success Handler**
```javascript
const handlePaymentSuccess = async (paymentIntent: any) => {
  setIsPaymentSuccess(true) // Prevent cart redirect
  toast.success('Payment successful! Order placed.')
  
  const redirectUrl = `/order-confirmation?payment_intent=${paymentIntent.id}`
  window.location.href = redirectUrl // Hard redirect
  
  setTimeout(() => {
    clearCart() // Clear cart after redirect
  }, 100)
}
```

### **3. Updated Cart Redirect Logic**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Only redirect if cart is empty and we're not processing payment or payment succeeded
  if (isClient && items.length === 0 && !isProcessing && !isPaymentSuccess) {
    router.push('/shop')
  }
}, [isClient, items.length, router, isProcessing, isPaymentSuccess])
```

## 🧪 **How to Test**

1. **Add items to cart** from shop page
2. **Go to checkout** and fill shipping info
3. **Use test card**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
4. **Click "Pay"**
5. **Should redirect** to order confirmation page

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

- ✅ Payment processes successfully
- ✅ Redirects to order confirmation page
- ✅ Shows beautiful confirmation with payment ID
- ✅ No more black page at `/checkout?`

## 🔍 **Debugging**

If still having issues:
1. **Check browser console** for payment success logs
2. **Test with "Test Redirect" button** first
3. **Verify order confirmation page** works independently
4. **Check network tab** for failed requests

The payment flow should now work end-to-end without redirect conflicts!
