# Hydration Fix Applied

## ðŸ”§ **Problem Fixed**

The error `useCart must be used within a CartProvider` was occurring because:

1. **Zustand with persistence** was being accessed during server-side rendering
2. **Client-side hydration** wasn't properly handled
3. **Components were trying to access the store** before it was initialized

## âœ… **Solution Applied**

### **1. Checkout Page (`src/pages/checkout.tsx`)**
- Added `isClient` state to track client-side hydration
- Only access `useCart` after client-side hydration
- Added loading state while hydrating
- Safe fallbacks for cart functions

### **2. Navigation Component (`src/components/Navigation.tsx`)**
- Added client-side hydration check
- Safe access to cart functions
- Prevents hydration mismatch errors

### **3. Cart Component (`src/components/Cart.tsx`)**
- Added client-side hydration check
- Safe access to all cart functions
- Prevents SSR/hydration issues

## ðŸš€ **How It Works Now**

1. **Server-side**: Components render with safe fallbacks
2. **Client-side**: `useEffect` sets `isClient = true`
3. **Hydration**: Cart store is safely accessed
4. **No errors**: Hydration mismatch resolved

## ðŸ§ª **Testing**

The checkout page should now:

1. âœ… **Load without errors**
2. âœ… **Show loading state briefly**
3. âœ… **Display checkout form with items**
4. âœ… **Process payments correctly**
5. âœ… **Redirect to order confirmation**

## ðŸ“Š **Expected Behavior**

- **First load**: Brief loading spinner, then checkout form
- **Empty cart**: Redirect to shop page
- **With items**: Full checkout flow
- **Payment success**: Redirect to order confirmation

The hydration error should be completely resolved!
